        <h2>The challenge</h2>
        <p>FedEx Latin America was looking to increase the number of customers who where registering for an online account. They also asked for help updating the FedEx “Welcome” page, only available in English at the time, to better service markets
          in Puerto Rico and Mexico.</p>
        <p>There was no available data on customer engagement and customer onboarding was a disjointed process that was not fully automated or properly documented.</p>
        <p>Additional technical constraints had to be accounted for, such as those imposed by the content management system being used at the time (TeamSite).</p>

      <div>
        <h2>Understanding customer goals</h2>
        <p>FedEx had been approaching the lack of customer engagement as a marketing problem, without considering the customer’s journey.</p>
        <p>Understanding what customers in Latin America where experiencing after they opened a FedEx account was my first priority.</p>
        <p>I spent a good amount of time documenting workflows and figuring out how FedEx was communicating with its Latin American customers. Through this process I was able to recommend four areas of improvement.</p>
        <h3>Communicate value</h3>
        <p>Customers where receiving emails focused on selling features rather than outlining the benefits of registering for an online account. Customers where simply not aware that opening an account online is not the same as registering for an
          online
          account.</p>
        <h3>Unified strategy</h3>
        <p>While interviewing stakeholders, I uncovered that regional customer service teams in Mexico and Puerto Rico had created their own customer onboarding workflows.</p>
        <h3>Speak your customer's language</h3>
        <p>The "Welcome" page for new customers was only available in English.</p>
        <h3>Keep it relevant</h3>
        <p>Onboarding emails lacked proper timing, frequency, design, and messaging.</p>

      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>The solution</h2>
        <p>I created an improved email content strategy and delivered guidelines with new onboarding flows, recommended copy in Spanish, mockups for reminder and follow-up emails, and landing pages with adaptable content that can accommodate
          customers in Mexico and Puerto Rico.</p>
        <p>The implemented design is available at <a href="http://www.fedex.com/pr/newcustomer/" target="_blank">FedEx Puerto Rico</a>.</p>
