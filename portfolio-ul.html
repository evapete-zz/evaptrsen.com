        <h2>Working for a safer world</h2>
        <p>As one of the most trusted safety compliance systems in the world, UL needed an improved B2B client portal that could provide a quick and easy way to access safety certification data, quotes, orders, safety inspection reports, procedures,
          and global certifications.</p>
        <p>The goal was to build a tool that would empower UL’s customers to make more informed, data driven decisions.</p>
      </div>

      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Listen, learn, design</h2>
        <p>At the time, I knew little to nothing about safety certification. I listened closely as we collaborated with our colleagues at UL to understand how users accessed certification data and then deep dived to identify gaps in the existing
          process.</p>
        <p>We noted everything we thought was unclear and relied on extensive task analyses, experience maps, and sketching to better understand the challenges faced.</p>
        <p>Most users complained about the fact that finding certification data was an obscure process that was manually intensive (think paper forms). They were also apprehensive about how digital access to this information would affect their
          workflow.</p>

        <h2>Goal-centered design</h2>
        <p>We moved forward designing a system that would streamline a once laborious and time-consuming process through a clear, attractive and highly functional interface.</p>
        <p>Through intensive collaboration with the team at UL, we were able to narrow down the functionality that would be most useful for UL customers. These include guided keyword search, search refinement, and the ability to filter search results
          based on relevant criteria.</p>

        <h2>Stakeholders</h2>
        <p>Over the course of six months, my <a href="https://wayfinder-ux.com/">WAYFINDER</a> teammates and I, met with key business leads and subject matter experts at UL’s headquarters in Northbrook, IL.</p>
        <p>We led discovery workshops that included card sorting activities and whiteboarding sessions that later helped us organize content and key functionalities.</p>
        <p>We frequently requested feedback from developers as well. Design reviews where conducted remotely and facilitated by sharing design concepts using Marvel.</p>
        <p>Detailed wireframes, mockups and style-guides allowed the development team to focus on building everything properly. Design specifications where delivered to the development team using Zeplin.</p>

        <h2>Practical and reliable solutions</h2>
        <p>UL received a responsive web-based solution that can be used from anywhere, at anytime - <a href="https://my.ul.com/home"> MyUL Portal</a>.</p>
        <p>We also delivered a component based design system that ensures a consistent experience for the user while reducing development costs.</p>
        <p>In March of 2019, UL also launched <a href="https://iq.ulprospector.com/info/">UL Product iQ</a>, a modern search engine platform, with an online directory that delivers more accurate and advanced search results though a clear and easy to
          understand UI.</p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>UL now offers a modern search engine platform, with an online directory that delivers more accurate and advanced search results with an improved user experience.</p>
        <p>In March of 2019, UL launched a modified version of our proposed concept as <a href="https://iq.ulprospector.com/info/">UL Product iQ</a>.</p>
